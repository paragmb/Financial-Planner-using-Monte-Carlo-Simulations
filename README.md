# Module5Challenge

This financial analysis contains the two following financial planners within a single Jupyter notebook:

A financial planner for emergencies: The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

A financial planner for retirement: This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

Before using the notebook, user should have created their own .env file that stores the values of Alpaca API key and Alpaca secret key.

Please open the financial_planning_tools.ipynb. Restart the kernel.

Based on the Monte Carlo simulation results for 30-yr and 10-yr forecasts, answers to the questions have been provided in Part 2.
